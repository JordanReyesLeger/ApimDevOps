    post:
      summary: Create resource
      description: A demonstration of a POST call based on the echo backend above. The request body is expected to contain JSON-formatted data (see example below). A policy is used to automatically transform any request sent in JSON directly to XML. In a real-world scenario this could be used to enable modern clients to speak to a legacy backend.
